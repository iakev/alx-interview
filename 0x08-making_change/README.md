# Making Change

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Making Change" project! This repository contains a Python program that demonstrates an algorithm for making change using various denominations of coins. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins required to make a specific amount of change.

## Program Description

### [making_change.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-interview/blob/main/0x08-making_change/0-making_change.py)

The `making_change.py` program implements an algorithm to find the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given amount using a dynamic programming approach. It calculates and returns the minimum number of coins needed for any given amount and set of coin denominations.

## Compiling and Executing

To run the `making_change.py` program, you'll need to have Python installed on your system.

### Example for executing `making_change.py`:

```shell
python making_change.py
```

Simply run the program with Python, and it will demonstrate how to make change efficiently.
