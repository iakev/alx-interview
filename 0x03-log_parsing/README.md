# Log Parsing Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Log Parsing Challenge** repository. This repository contains Python scripts that parse log files and extract specific information from them. The challenge is designed to test your Python programming and log parsing skills.

## Program Descriptions

- [0-generator.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-interview/blob/main/0x03-log_parsing/0-generator.py): This Python script generates simulated log data and writes it to a file. It's used to create log files for testing the log parsing scripts.

- [0-stats.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-interview/blob/main/0x03-log_parsing/0-stats.py): This Python script parses log files and extracts specific information, including the number of lines read, status codes encountered, and the total file size.

## Compiling and Executing

To run the `0-stats.py` script, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the `0x03-log_parsing` directory:

   ```bash
   cd 0x03-log_parsing
   ```

3. Execute the script using the Python interpreter:

```bash
python 0-stats.py <log_file>
```

Replace `<log_file>` with the path to the log file you want to parse. The script will display the extracted information from the log file.

To use the `0-generator.py` script, you can follow similar steps. Make sure to specify the log file path and adjust any parameters as needed.
