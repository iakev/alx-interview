# ALX Interview Preparation - Star Wars API

## Introduction

Welcome to the **ALX Interview Preparation - Star Wars API** repository. This repository contains JavaScript scripts for interacting with the Star Wars API (SWAPI). These scripts allow you to retrieve information about various aspects of the Star Wars universe, including characters, starships, planets, and more.

## Program Descriptions

- [0-starwars_characters.js](https://github.com/iakev/alx-interview/blob/main/0x06-starwars_api/0-starwars_characters.js): This JavaScript script fetches and displays a list of Star Wars characters from the SWAPI.

## Compiling and Executing

To run the JavaScript script in this directory, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the JavaScript script you want to run.

3. Use the `node` command to execute the script. Replace `script.js` with the name of the JavaScript script you want to run:

```bash
node script.js
```

For example, to run `0-starwars_characters.js`, you would use:

```bash
node 0-starwars_characters.js
```
