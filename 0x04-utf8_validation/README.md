# UTF-8 Validation Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the **UTF-8 Validation Challenge** repository. This repository contains Python scripts designed to validate whether a given list of data represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Program Descriptions

- [0-validate_utf8.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-interview/blob/main/0x04-utf8_validation/0-validate_utf8.py): This Python script checks if a list of integers represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Compiling and Executing

To run the `0-validate_utf8.py` script, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the `0x04-utf8_validation` directory:

   ```bash
   cd 0x04-utf8_validation
   ```

3. Execute the script using the Python interpreter and provide a list of integers as arguments:

    ```bash
    python 0-validate_utf8.py 197 130 1
    ```

4. Replace 197 130 1 with your list of integers to validate. The script will display whether the input represents a valid UTF-8 encoding or not.

Feel free to explore the code and test different input lists to validate UTF-8 encodings.

For more information on UTF-8 encoding and validation, refer to [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) Encoding on Wikipedia.

This challenge is designed to test your Python programming skills and your understanding of character encoding.
