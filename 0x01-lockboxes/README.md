# ALX Interview Preparation - Lockboxes Challenge

Welcome to the **ALX Interview Preparation** repository. This challenge is part of our effort to help you prepare for technical interviews and coding challenges commonly encountered in the field of software engineering and development.

## Introduction

The `0x01-lockboxes` challenge focuses on solving problems related to lockboxes, specifically how to determine if all the boxes can be unlocked given a set of keys. The goal is to develop algorithms and solutions to unlock all the boxes optimally.

## Program Description

- **[lockboxes.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-interview/blob/main/0x01-lockboxes/0-lockboxes.py):** Python script containing the solution for the lockboxes challenge.

## Compiling and Executing

To run the Python script in this directory, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the `0x01-lockboxes` directory.

3. Use the python command to execute the script:

   ```bash
   python lockboxes.py
   ```

For example, to run `lockboxes.py`, you would use:

```bash
python lockboxes.py
```
